## Design Enclosure 
The enclosure was designed to house the following components:
- Lilygo T-RGB board
- PCB scanner module
- Button
- 3.7V Battery (JST mini connector)
- On/Off shifter
- 2x M3 wooden screws

The design includes a holding space for the battery and multiple fixtures for all other components. Since the project is still in the developement phase all fixtures were kept simple and reversible, to insure easy access to all components. Additionally screw holdings were put to give the option of closing the device. They are supposed to be used with wooden screws and cant be opened infinitivly afterwards, since the thread will break. But the device closes firmly without screws, so for developement purposes they are not needed.

## Printing Orientation:
The Printing Orientation was optimized for better surface texture. It was found to be best to orient the top part open side down, while orienting the bottom part open side up. The open side beeing the side where the components are mounted. Printing slower and with minimized thickness of 0.1mm per slice, gave the best results of a relativly even and nice to touch surface.

## Further Improvements:
The USB-C port access could be optimized and the fixtures changed to more durable solutions if the design is more definit.
