## Plastic Scanner


## Introduction

## How it works
The PlasticScanner allows you to identify six different plastic types by using an approach called **discreate near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy **. The IR LED's on the Scanner module emitt light one-by-one for a short period of time. Each time the reflectance of the emitted light is measured by a Photodiode. This results in a Spectralanalysis of the measured reflectance.The plastic identification works by comparing each measurment with the distinct reflectance spectrum of the six plastic types.
